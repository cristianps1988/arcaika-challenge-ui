# Technical Test for Arcaika UI

Technical test for the company Arcaika. This project is a user interface that consumes data from a custom API previously developed in the first part of this challenge. For this project we used React.js, Vite.js for initialization, tailwind.CSS for styling, redux to handle global data state and other packages to handle aspects such as routes, connection to third party endpoints. Custom hooks were also used to handle global state information more easily.
